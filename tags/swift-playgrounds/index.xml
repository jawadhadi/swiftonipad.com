      <description>Yes, the wait is finally over now. Apple just dropped the long awaited update for Swift Playgrounds, you can download the latest version from App Store (download links at bottom). It brings the ability to develop iPhone and iPad apps right from any iPad running iPadOS 15.2 or later. So if your iPad got the iPadOS 15 update, you are in for the treat.
However for the Mac app, story is different, it just adds support for Swift 5.</description>

      <description>Finally seems like the wait is about to get over and soon you will be able to install Swift Playgrounds 4 on your iPads. Apple.com still mentions vague &amp;ldquo;available late 2021&amp;rdquo; release date, but you should expect the release within a couple of weeks. Why? Here are some points to back it:
Update: Apple released final versions of Xocde 13.2 and iPadOS 15.2 on December 13th, but we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen any prominent progress regarding Swift Playgrounds 4 yet, except that &amp;ldquo;Available late 2021&amp;rdquo; footnote has been removed from iPadOS 15 page.</description>
