      <description>Finally seems like the wait is about to get over and soon you will be able to install Swift Playgrounds 4 on your iPads. Apple.com still mentions vague &amp;ldquo;available late 2021&amp;rdquo; release date, but you should expect the release within a couple of weeks. Why? Here are some points to back it:
Update: Apple released final versions of Xocde 13.2 and iPadOS 15.2 on December 13th, but we haven&amp;rsquo;t seen any prominent progress regarding Swift Playgrounds 4 yet, except that &amp;ldquo;Available late 2021&amp;rdquo; footnote has been removed from iPadOS 15 page.</description>

Later that day we saw a short demo of the new Playgrounds during “Platforms State of the Union”, a developer centric keynote that dives deeper into the newly announced tools and technologies. Since that day we haven&amp;rsquo;t heard anything more about the Playgrounds 4 update.</description>
