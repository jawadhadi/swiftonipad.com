<p>Finally seems like the wait is about to get over and soon you will be able to install Swift Playgrounds 4 on your iPads. Apple.com still mentions vague &ldquo;available late 2021&rdquo; release date, but you should expect the release within a couple of weeks. Why? Here are some points to back it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Xcode 13.2 beta (released initially on October 27th) has support for &ldquo;app projects created with Swift Playgrounds 4&rdquo;.</li>
<li>As reported by <a href="https://9to5mac.com/2021/11/29/heres-a-first-look-at-the-new-swift-playgrounds-4-ahead-of-official-release/">9to5mac</a>, Apple has invited some developers to test Swift Playgrounds 4 beta via TestFlight. Also the article mentions &ldquo;some of the app’s features require iPadOS 15.2&rdquo;, and that leads to the third point.</li>
<li>iPadOS 15.2 beta 4 was released last week, and from the release schedule of recent betas we should expect the next release (most probably Release Candidate or final) within two weeks.</li>
</ol>
<p>Although everything is pointing to an imminent release, still there could be some timeline changes if Apple is not happy with the feedback from beta testers.</p>
